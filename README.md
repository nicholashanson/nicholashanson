ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Nick.

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a software engineer who loves building cool stuff.

I'm obsessed with my code - maybe you can relate? My head is always full of a hundred ways it can be improved:
more modular, more readable, more testable, more optimized... I should go touch some grass.

Projects I'm currently obsessing over:
1) Automata
2) Fluxion
