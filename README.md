Welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸŽ‰

I'm a software engineer who loves building cool stuff ðŸ’».

I'm obsessed with my code â€” maybe you can relate? ðŸ˜… My head is always full of a hundred ways it can be improved: more modular, more readable, more testable, more optimized... I should go touch some grass ðŸŒ±.

Projects I'm currently obsessing over:
Fluxion (fluid_simulation) ðŸŒ€:
Most of my coding time is currently spent here. The goals of the project are to:

ðŸ”¹ Get to real-time rendering for simple fluid simulations and as close to real-time as possible for more complex simulations using run-of-the-mill hardware.

ðŸ”¹ Be as composable as possible with support for all different kinds of solvers. These are fairly ambitious goals, and this is really intended to be a very long-term project. There is only support for LBM at the moment.
Most of my time so far has been spent on the infrastructure of the project (environment set-up, GPU acceleration set-up, profiling etc.) rather than building out the actual solvers.

Automata (automata) ðŸ”²:

This project got me interested in simulations and led me to start the Fluxion project. There are no real goals here from a software engineering perspective beyond making the code clean and of good quality âœ¨. The science behind automata is fascinating, and I would like to explore this topic more later on ðŸš€.
